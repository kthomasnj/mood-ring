# mood-ring
Every mood has a ring.  No matter what you are feeling, the Mood Ring application will cater to your mood.  If you are feeling happy, use the emojis to set your mood and the application will reflect your current mood with music, background colors, quotes/tips and photos to help keep the serotonin and dopamine flowing.  Conversely, if you're feeling down and just want to feel your feels, we got you.  We'll set you up with the right music, background colors, quotes and tips to match your energy.  If you wish to change your mood, you can go to previously saved moods to recreate a vibe.
